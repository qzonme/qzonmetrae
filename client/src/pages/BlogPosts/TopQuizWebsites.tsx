              If you're into quizzes, games, or interactive fun, you've probably seen dozens of quiz sites floating 
              around the internet. But not all quiz platforms are created equal. Here's a look at the top 7 quiz 
              websites in 2024 — and what makes QzonMe different:
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">1. BuzzFeed Quizzes</a></h2>
            <p>
              The original viral quiz hub. Great for pop culture and humor, but mostly editorial-based — you can't 
              create personal quizzes easily.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://quizlet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">2. Quizlet</a></h2>
            <p>
              Perfect for studying and flashcards. Not designed for fun or personality quizzes.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://kahoot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">3. Kahoot!</a></h2>
            <p>
              Popular in classrooms and corporate training. Engaging but requires live participation and a separate host.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://www.playbuzz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">4. Playbuzz</a></h2>
            <p>
              Used to be a big player for interactive storytelling, but is less active now.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://quizizz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">5. Quizizz</a></h2>
            <p>
              Another education-heavy tool. Gamified learning, but not really for personal bonding quizzes.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">6. ProProfs Quiz Maker</a></h2>
            <p>
              Great for making advanced quizzes, but it's built for formal testing and requires more setup.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://qzonme.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">7. QzonMe 🧠</a></h2>
            <p>
              Made for fun, fast, personal quizzes. QzonMe lets you build a quiz about yourself, add images, and 
              instantly generate a shareable link. It's quick, easy, and built for social sharing and laughs — not classrooms.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If you're looking to test your friends, entertain your group chat, or surprise your followers, 
              QzonMe is your go-to platform.
