            <p>
              Ask friends to guess your favorite color, song, snack, movie, or season. A great way to test if 
              they've really been paying attention.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. This or That?</h2>
            <p>
              Would you choose dogs or cats? Pizza or burgers? Summer or winter? Add a few wildcards to throw them off!
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. If I Won the Lotteryâ€¦</h2>
            <p>
              Would you travel the world, buy a yacht, or open a cat cafe? Let them guess your dream scenario.

            <h2>4. Song Lyrics I Relate To</h2>

            <h2>5. My Dream Vacation</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>7. How Would I React?</h2>
            <p>
