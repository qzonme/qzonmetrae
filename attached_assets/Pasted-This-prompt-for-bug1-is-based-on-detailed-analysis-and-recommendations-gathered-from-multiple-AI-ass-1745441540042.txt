🚨 BUG 1: Quiz creation still uses the old name (“emydan”) even after entering a new name like “daniel”

✅ Fix Instructions:
- Ensure the quiz creation input is controlled via `useState`, like:
  const [quizName, setQuizName] = useState('');
- When submitting, use that quizName state value directly in the fetch/post body:
  fetch("/api/create-quiz", { body: JSON.stringify({ name: quizName }) })
- Reset the input field with `setQuizName("")` after submission
- Add a `key={Date.now()}` to the quiz form wrapper to force a clean remount
- On the backend, generate the quiz slug using:
  `${slugify(name)}-${Date.now()}`
- Make sure the backend does not reuse global variables or cached request state between quiz creations

🚨 BUG 2: “View Your Answers” incorrectly marks all answers as wrong
When a user finishes answering a quiz and clicks “View Your Answers”:

- Even when the user selects the correct answer, the answer is still marked as incorrect
- The score summary may say “1 out of 6” but all the individual answers are shown in red or as failed
- The actual selected option is not clearly highlighted or is treated as incorrect even if it matches the correct one

Please investigate and fix this logic so that user-selected answers are properly compared against the correct ones and displayed accurately on the result page.
✅ Final confirmation checklist:
- Quiz link should reflect **only** the name currently typed by the user (never “emydan” unless retyped)
- Answer review should accurately show the user’s selected option and correct result
- Answer highlighting should be clear, intuitive, and not buggy
- Tested and confirmed working across browsers and devices

Please carefully implement and verify these changes across the full create-answer-result flow. Thanks!
