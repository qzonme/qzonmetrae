CHANGES TO MAKE;
So I applied to google adsense but was rejected based on these reasons they stated;
Why Your Site Wasn't Approved
Google AdSense has rejected your site (qzonme.com) for two reasons:
1. Low Value Content
They believe your site:
‚Ä¢	Doesn't yet offer unique, useful, or high-quality content.
‚Ä¢	Looks incomplete or feels like it‚Äôs not ready for real users.
‚Ä¢	Lacks enough written content (text-based pages, blog posts, help pages, etc.)
2. Ads Shown Without Publisher Content
They found pages that:
‚Ä¢	Show Google ads but don‚Äôt have real written content.
‚Ä¢	May just have navigation, images, forms, or behavior-only screens (like a quiz creation form or leaderboard with no surrounding info).
So will love for you to make some changes on the website like;
1.Add some sections on the home page like;
a.why use qzonme or what is qzonme or  intro to qzonme.
 with some writings and explaining for the section just like blogs
b.Key features section too with some article or writings or explanations
c.FAQ/how it works section with some article or writings or explanations
d. blogs sections with links and little descriptions to the blogposts as will be given below
2. add a contact page on the website footer and on the contact page add fields for people to enter their names,email and messages to be sent to my email and tell me how this works will I have to come there and check the messages or I will give you my email address for you to send to or will you add admin page where I can access their entered email address,names and messages?

Blog Post 1: Why QzonMe Is the Funniest Way to Bond
Have you ever thought your friends knew everything about you, only to find out they got your favorite snack, color, or vacation spot completely wrong? That awkward moment when your bestie thinks you prefer pineapple on pizza when you actually hate it? That‚Äôs the kind of funny chaos QzonMe thrives on.
QzonMe isn‚Äôt just another quiz platform. It‚Äôs a space where humor, friendship, and personality collide. The quizzes you create are about you‚Äîyour likes, your memories, your quirks‚Äîand then you throw those questions at your friends to see how well they really know you. That alone leads to some hilarious moments.
What makes it even better is how easy and fun it is to use. In less than a minute, you can build a full quiz with custom questions and even add images for flair. Then share your unique link and wait for the laughs to roll in. It‚Äôs perfect for bonding with friends, breaking the ice in group chats, or just killing time with something more personal than scrolling memes.
Whether it‚Äôs roasting your friends for getting every answer wrong or cheering on someone who gets a perfect score, QzonMe turns friendship into a game. And it‚Äôs one that never gets old.

Blog Post 2: Top 7 Quiz Websites in 2024 (And Why QzonMe Stands Out)
If you're into quizzes, games, or interactive fun, you‚Äôve probably seen dozens of quiz sites floating around the internet. But not all quiz platforms are created equal. Here‚Äôs a look at the top 7 quiz websites in 2024 ‚Äî and what makes QzonMe different:
1. BuzzFeed Quizzes
The original viral quiz hub. Great for pop culture and humor, but mostly editorial-based ‚Äî you can't create personal quizzes easily.
2. Quizlet
Perfect for studying and flashcards. Not designed for fun or personality quizzes.
3. Kahoot!
Popular in classrooms and corporate training. Engaging but requires live participation and a separate host.
4. Playbuzz
Used to be a big player for interactive storytelling, but is less active now.
5. Quizizz
Another education-heavy tool. Gamified learning, but not really for personal bonding quizzes.
6. ProProfs
Great for making advanced quizzes, but it‚Äôs built for formal testing and requires more setup.
7. QzonMe üß†
Made for fun, fast, personal quizzes. QzonMe lets you build a quiz about yourself, add images, and instantly generate a shareable link. It‚Äôs quick, easy, and built for social sharing and laughs ‚Äî not classrooms.
If you're looking to test your friends, entertain your group chat, or surprise your followers, QzonMe is your go-to platform.
