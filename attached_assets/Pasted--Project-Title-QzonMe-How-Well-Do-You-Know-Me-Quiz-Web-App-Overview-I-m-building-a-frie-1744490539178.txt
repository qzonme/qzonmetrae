🧠 Project Title: QzonMe – “How Well Do You Know Me?” Quiz Web App

📄 Overview:
I’m building a friendship quiz web app called QzonMe (domain: QzonMe.com). It allows users to create a personalized quiz with at least 5 questions (can be more), and share a link for their friends to try and see how well they know them.

🎯 Core Features:

Visitors first input their name before creating or answering any quiz.

While creating a quiz:

The creator sets each question as either multiple choice (1 correct answer) or open-ended (2+ acceptable correct answers).

Only open-ended questions can include optional tips.

A minimum of 5 questions must be set (can be more).

After quiz creation, a unique shareable link is generated.

Friends visiting the link will:

Land on a home page with an intro, leaderboard, and name input form.

Answer one question per page.

See a results page at the end, showing correct/incorrect answers, score, and updated leaderboard.

Option to create their own quiz after seeing results.

Leaderboard is visible:

To quiz creator via a personal dashboard.

To anyone answering before or after they complete the quiz.

Navigation via Start, Next, and Submit buttons that dynamically load the next view (next question or results).

Should be responsive and mobile-friendly.

🎨 Styling and Branding:

Embedded in a Blogger site using an iframe (no scrollbar or border).

Should nearly fill the page width of the Blogger site.

Design colors:

Primary: #FF4403 for buttons, icons, and logo

CTA Hover/Highlight: #E76F51

💰 Ad Placement (Adsterra)
Add placeholder <div>s or comments for future ad integration:

1 banner/native ad container per page (shown when creating or answering).

1 interstitial ad trigger after every 5 questions answered (for both creators and answerers).

🛠️ What I want the AI to generate now:

Quiz answering flow (1 question per page)

Result/Leaderboard display

Basic styling using CSS (clean layout, responsive, color theme applied)

Simple JS to handle navigating between views/pages (Start > Q1 > Q2 > … > Results)

Dummy placeholder data/functions for:

Storing questions/answers

Generating and linking quizzes

Updating and displaying the leaderboard
