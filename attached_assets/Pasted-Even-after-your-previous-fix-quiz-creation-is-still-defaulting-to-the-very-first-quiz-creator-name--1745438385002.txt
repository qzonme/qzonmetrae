Even after your previous fix, quiz creation is still defaulting to the very first quiz creator name ever entered (e.g., “emydan”) — even after refreshing, clearing localStorage, and opening in a new session.

This confirms that:

Some part of the quiz creation logic still stores and reuses the original quiz creator name from memory, global state, or default variables

This value is not being cleared when starting a new quiz

Even if I manually enter a different name, the link still gets generated with the old name

✅ Please fully disconnect the quiz creation logic from any persistent state or fallback logic.

Do this by:

Resetting any useState, useEffect, context, or global variable that holds the quiz creator name

Ensuring the name passed into the backend comes only from the current input field, and not from any stored reference

Confirming that quiz creation starts clean every time — regardless of browser history or device reuse

🚨 ADDITIONAL BUG 1: VIEW ANSWERS NOT WORKING

On the result page, after finishing a quiz, when I click “View Your Answers”:

The answer review section does not show the options I chose

It instead shows a blank or no answer provided, making it look like I failed every question

The score calculation shows “1 out of 6,” but the detailed review shows 0 correct

✅ Please:

Fix the answer review logic to display the actual options the user selected

Ensure that correct vs. incorrect answers are shown clearly

Highlight which ones were selected and which were correct, with distinct styles

🚨 ADDITIONAL BUG 2: LEADERBOARD STYLE VISIBILITY ISSUE

On the result page, the leaderboard section is showing the current answerer’s name and score hidden behind an orange overlay or background.

The orange highlight (which likely indicates “this is you”) is covering the name and score

Only the rank number is visible, and the name/score only appears when I try to select the text with my mouse

✅ Please:

Fix the CSS styling so that the orange highlight does not obscure the user’s name and score

Make sure the leaderboard layout is readable and works across all screen sizes

📌 Confirm this checklist is working correctly:

Quiz link generation uses only the current input name — never a reused name like “emydan”

Dashboard link is unique and appears correctly

Answer review section reflects the user’s actual selected answers

Leaderboard highlights the current user without hiding their name/score

These bugs are blocking core user flows and must be fully resolved before launch. Please re-test everything end-to-end after fixing.
