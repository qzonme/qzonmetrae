Please implement the following full update to my QzonMe quiz website:

---

1Ô∏è‚É£ FIX QUIZ LINK BUG:

Right now, when I try to create a new quiz and enter a fresh name (e.g., ‚Äúadam‚Äù), the app still generates a quiz link using a previous quiz creator's name (e.g., ‚Äúwizzy‚Äù), even across different browsers and devices. This causes major bugs and confusion.

Fix this by:

- Always using the name entered in the current session during quiz creation to generate the quiz link.
- Completely ignore any stored or cached quiz creator name from localStorage, React state, or memory.
- Ensure each new quiz starts with a clean state and generates a fresh, unique link like `/quiz/adam-xxxxx`.
- Do not reuse previous quiz names or IDs unless manually entered again.

2Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENT SECURE DASHBOARD ACCESS USING TOKENS:

We are removing the old localStorage-based system and replacing it with a secure, token-based system for dashboard access.

- After a quiz is created, generate a secure dashboard token (e.g., UUID or unique hash).
- Store this token in the database with the quiz data.
- After creation, show the user a unique dashboard link like:  
  `/dashboard/<dashboard-token>`
- Do not save this to localStorage. Instead, the user should manually copy or bookmark the link.
- When a dashboard link is visited, load quiz results and leaderboard based only on the token ‚Äî not on any stored session.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ ENFORCE 30-DAY EXPIRATION FOR QUIZZES AND DASHBOARDS:

- All quizzes and dashboard tokens should automatically expire 30 days after their creation.
- Add a `createdAt` timestamp when each quiz is created and saved.
- Prevent loading of expired quizzes or dashboards and show a message like ‚ÄúThis quiz is no longer available‚Äù if it has passed 30 days.
- Ensure both quiz links and dashboard links respect this expiration window.

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ ADD EXPIRATION WARNING TO USERS:

After a quiz is created, when the shareable link is displayed, also show a message below like:

üïí **Note:** This quiz and its dashboard will remain active for 30 days from today. After that, the link will expire and no longer be accessible.

Style this with a subtle tooltip or info box so it‚Äôs clearly visible but not distracting.

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ REMOVE ‚ÄúVIEW MY DASHBOARD‚Äù BUTTON FROM HOMEPAGE:

We are no longer using localStorage to manage dashboard access, so please:

- Remove the ‚ÄúView My Dashboard‚Äù button from the homepage
- Do not check or store any quiz creator ID in localStorage
- The only way to access the dashboard should now be through the unique `/dashboard/token` link provided after quiz creation

---

Please confirm that:

- New quiz links are generated based only on the name entered
- Dashboard links are token-based and work across devices
- No localStorage is used
- Quizzes and dashboards expire after 30 days
- Users are notified clearly about the expiration limit
- The homepage is clean with only ‚ÄúCreate Quiz‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnswer Quiz‚Äù buttons

This is the full update to complete the transition to a more stable, secure, and shareable experience for all users.
