I understand you're having issues with your custom domain connections on the Replit platform. This is a common issue that can happen for several reasons, and since Replit Support has escalated it to their engineering team, it suggests there might be a platform-specific issue.

Let me help you diagnose and work around this while you wait for the engineering team's response:

Possible Causes and Workarounds
DNS Configuration Issues

Check that your DNS records are correctly set up with CNAME pointing to your Replit subdomain
Make sure you've waited 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
SSL Certificate Problems

Replit might be having issues with SSL certificate provisioning for your custom domain
This would cause HTTPS connection failures
Replit Configuration

Ensure your domain is properly verified in your Replit account settings
Try removing and re-adding the custom domain in your Replit settings
Temporary Workaround

While waiting for a fix, you can update your application to handle both custom domains and the default Replit domain
Let's modify the code to ensure it works with both domains:
Let's check and update your domain handling in the code:


Opened client/src/components/quiz/ShareQuiz.tsx
Let's implement a more flexible domain handling approach to make sure your application works while the custom domain issue is being resolved by Replit's engineering team:


Edited client/src/components/quiz/ShareQuiz.tsx
Now let's update the dashboard link display and copy functionality to include the fallback link as well:


Edited client/src/components/quiz/ShareQuiz.tsx
Now, let's update the UI to show both the primary and fallback links:


Edited client/src/components/quiz/ShareQuiz.tsx
Now let's update the dashboard link display and add the fallback link there too:


Edited client/src/components/quiz/ShareQuiz.tsx
Let's also update the result page to provide an alternative sharing link. First, let's view the Results.tsx component:


Opened client/src/pages/Results.tsx
Let's look at the part of the Results.tsx where it's rendering the share link:


Executed grep -n "shareMessage\|quizLink" client/src/pages/Results.tsx
Let's look at more of the Results.tsx file to find the sharing functionality:

Let's view the remaining portions of the Results.tsx file:


Opened client/src/pages/Results.tsx
Looking at our recent progress, I've been working on addressing the issue with custom domain accessibility by implementing fallback links:

✓ Changed from relying solely on the custom domain (qzonme.com)
✓ Added fallback links using the current domain/URL the user is accessing from
✓ Updated ShareQuiz.tsx to display both primary and alternative links
✓ Modified clipboard functionality to copy both links for easier sharing

I'll continue fixing any remaining references to ensure the application works reliably even when custom domains are temporarily unavailable. This approach provides a backup solution while Replit's engineering team addresses the custom domain issues.

I'll continue implementing the dual-domain approach to ensure your application remains accessible regardless of custom domain status. Let's check for any remaining components that may be hardcoding the custom domain.

Let's search for ResultsView component:


Executed find client/src -name "ResultsView.tsx" || find client/src -name "*Results*.tsx"
Let's check the ResultsView component for any hardcoded domain references:


Opened client/src/components/quiz/ResultsView.tsx
Great! ResultsView doesn't have hardcoded domain references. Let's search for more components that might be using the custom domain:


Executed grep -r "qzonme.com" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" client/src/ | grep -v ShareQuiz.tsx
The Privacy.tsx file has a reference to the custom domain, but it's just informational text and doesn't affect functionality.

Let's find any MetaTags components since they might be using custom domains for OpenGraph tags:


Opened client/src/components/common/MetaTags.tsx
The MetaTags component is already using dynamic URLs based on the current window location, which is good. Now let's check for any other components that might handle links generation:


Opened client/src/pages/FindQuiz.tsx
The FindQuiz component already handles URLs dynamically by parsing out just the slug, so no changes needed there.

Let's check for any custom domain references in the server code:


Executed grep -r "qzonme.com" --include="*.ts" server/
Great! I don't see any server-side references to the custom domain.

Let's test the application to make sure our changes are working correctly:


Took a screenshot
I've implemented a dual-domain approach to handle the custom domain availability issue:

✓ Added fallback link generation using the current domain
✓ Updated ShareQuiz component to display both primary and fallback links
✓ Modified clipboard functionality to copy both links
✓ Ensured all link generation is dynamic

This approach provides a robust solution while waiting for Replit's engineering team to fix the custom domain issue. Users can now access the application through both the custom domain (when available) and the Replit domain.

Is everything displaying correctly with these changes? Would you like me to make any adjustments to the UI or functionality?
