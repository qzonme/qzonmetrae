There are still critical bugs that weren’t fully fixed in the last update. Please read carefully:

🚨 ISSUE 1: QUIZ LINK GENERATES WITH OLD CREATOR NAME

Even after moving to token-based dashboards and supposedly removing localStorage usage, quiz creation is still generating links using **previous creator names** (e.g., “emydan”, “amarachi”) instead of the **name just entered** (e.g., “daniel”). This behavior happens even on new browsers and devices that were previously used during the local database version of the app.

This suggests one of the following is still happening:
- The quiz creation logic is referencing a cached in-memory value
- Or it’s still using values stored in an earlier version of local database or localStorage
- A fallback or default creator name is hardcoded or persistently stored and reused

✅ Please fix this by:
- Clearing or resetting all in-memory quiz creator references at the beginning of every new quiz creation
- Ensuring the app ONLY uses the name input entered at that moment to generate the quiz link
- Removing any fallback logic or default values tied to past stored names or data
- Deleting any hidden or leftover client-local or server-local database keys that may be causing name reuse

🚨 ISSUE 2: DASHBOARD LINK NEVER LOADS (“Loading dashboard link...”)

After a quiz is created, the “share link” page shows “Loading dashboard link...” but **never shows the actual dashboard link**. This happens even after multiple deployments and appears across multiple browsers and devices.

This issue may be caused by one of two things:
- The dashboard token is **not being generated properly**
- Or, the code is **still trying to fetch dashboard info based on the old quiz creator name or old quiz ID**, instead of using the new token-based system

✅ Please fix this by:
- Ensuring the dashboard token is generated **immediately after quiz creation** and saved to the database
- Updating the share page to fetch the dashboard token directly and render it immediately
- Making sure that the logic to load dashboard links does **not rely on quiz creator names or legacy IDs**
- Show a clear error message if token fetching fails

---

🚨 EXTRA CLEANUP: REMOVE ALL LOCAL DATABASE DEPENDENCIES

Please remove all remaining logic related to:
- Old local database or localStorage storage for quiz creation or dashboard access
- Any hardcoded fallback name, slug, or ID stored on the client or server
- Any legacy function that still tries to use quiz creator names to fetch dashboard data

The system should now be fully token-based:
- Dashboard access should be via `/dashboard/<token>`
- Quiz creation should rely **only on the name entered**, not stored values
- All expiration, leaderboard loading, and sharing should be based on the latest created data

---

✅ Confirmation Checklist:
- New quizzes generate unique links based only on the current name entered
- “Loading dashboard link...” is replaced with a working `/dashboard/<token>` link
- Old names (like “emydan” or “amarachi”) never show unless typed again
- Dashboard link generation and quiz link generation work correctly across all browsers and devices
- No references to localStorage, fallback memory, or old local database data remain

This bug is critical. It’s making quiz creation and dashboard access impossible to trust for users. Please fix all of this cleanly and confirm each fix.
